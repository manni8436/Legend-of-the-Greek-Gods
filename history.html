                Greek Mythology, The earliest known knowledge when Greek Mythology first started was approximately 2,700 years ago 
                and even after over two millennia the stories about gods, heroes and monsters are still being told and retold through 
                the generations to the very present day where all we have left of that civilization is the stories we are told and
                the temple ruins that were built for the Gods of Olympus which are in Athens,Greece and are one of the wonders of the world.

                The legend has it that Cronus, Titan King was the leader and the youngest of the first generation of Titans and was the son
                of Uranus (Father Sky) and Gaia (Mother Earth) who overthrew his father to rule the golden age, it is said that Cronus was 
                told by his parents that he would face the same fate as his father, Despite the warning from his parents, Cronus had children 
                and he would devoure them as soon as they were born to prevent the prophecy from coming true however when the sixth child was 
                soon to be born, Rhea went to her parents Uranos and Gaia for a plan to save Zeus.<br>

                Uranos and Gaia helped Rhea and took her to a island by the name of Crete where she secretly gave birth to Zeus and she left 
                the new born baby to her mother Gaia to raise while Rhea went back to Cronus while holding a stone wrapped in a cloth and as 
                soon as Cronus saw her, he quickly took the false baby and swallowed it while being completely unaware that his son Zeus lived.

                After the Titan War, Zeus and his brothers, Hades and Poseidon decided to divide the universe into three parts. They drew 
                straws to see who would rule over which parts, Zeus drew the longest straw which gave him the title of king of the sky.
                This also meant he was the ruler of the gods and mortals, Poseidon got the middle straw, so he became king of the sea and 
                finally hades drew the shortest straw, so he became the ruler of the Underworld and also known as the realm of the dead.
